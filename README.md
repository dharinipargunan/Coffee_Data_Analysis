# Coffee_Data_Analysis
Coffee Dataset consists of 3035 customers survey response for 12 different coffee brands.
Based on the responses, top 10 predictors / factors affecting the coffee brand is found by implementing machine learning algorithms for each of the brands

For predicting the top predictors, methods such as correlation analysis, chi_square score and also feature selection using ExtraTreeclassifier were implemented. 
Logistic regression model is implemented using all the features and also using the top 10 predictors and evaluated the test data. The classification report which consists of f1-score , accuracy, recall precision was printed.

For visualization and interactive dashboard the one hot encoded dataset was converted into categorical data and fed into tableau .
